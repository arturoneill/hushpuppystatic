  venues and promotion companies wanting to do regular event flyering, local publications wanting scheduled delivery routes, and any other
  individuals and businesses who would like regular errand services.

            <h3 id="target3">How does the personal errand service work?</h3>
          
<p>This is our personal, on-demand delivery service. You can place an order by calling, sending an email, or filling out the form in the 
  "Services" section of our website. Once you let us know what you need and when, we'll get right back to you to work out the logistics. 
  You can use our map to make sure your locations are in range, but give us a call if you're not sure. If you need us to pick up an item
  from a store and it is possible for you to pay ahead, we highly recommed you take care of that first. Otherwise, we can front up to $50
  if necessary. We can provide call, text, or email
  delivery confirmation upon request.
  <br>
  We have multiple options for accepting payment, including PayPal and Venmo.
  We take cash or card at pick-up/drop-off, and card over the phone. Payment service processing fees are applicable where they apply.
  No other processing fees or sales tax apply.

          <h3 id="target4">Why bikes?</h3>
                      
<p>Cycling an incredibly efficient way to deliver stuff within most urban and suburban areas.
  Bikes take no fossil fuels to run, take up far less space on the road, and are surprisingly capable tools for moving stuff.
  We have years of experience riding safely and efficiently in all weather and traffic conditions,
  and we've got the right gear to deliver your stuff properly. Between
  75L waterproof messenger backpacks, Front racks rated for 60lbs, 
  and insulated warming bags, we've got you covered. Also, we'll never hit the road without a helmet, bell, lights, and flat-change kit.
  We only take a job if weâ€™re positive we can complete it to your total satisifcation, 
  and if we think your delivery requires any extra packaging, we can advise you on how best to prepare it. 
  Most things packaged to travel by car will also travel just fine by bike. 
  That being said, we currently won't deliver drink orders not in bottles or cans, and we may also turn down cupcakes or other especially fragile food orders depending on packaging and distance.
